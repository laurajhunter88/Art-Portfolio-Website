          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I have been always a creative person. Growing up I loved singing,
            acting and dance.
            <br />

            Funnily enough, the only creative things I didn't do were painting
            and drawing! I did lessons at school but didn't take it for GCSE.
            Even as a child I was a perfectionist but I obviously didn't have
            the patience I do now as I used to get frustrated when my art wasn't
            perfect and then gave up. Two of my brothers are naturally gifted at
            art and I always used to compare myself to them. I'm very glad I
            developed some patience as I grew up! But this meant that when I
            stopped doing at at school, when I was 14 years old, I stopped doing
            art altogether. I didn't think there was any point as I was rubbish
            anyway.
            <br />
            <br />
            Cut to Covid... I was unable to go to singing lessons due to
            lockdown and as I need to do something creative regularly for my
            sanity I had a look around on Youtube and found acrylic pouring. I
            figured you don't need to be able to draw to do that so gave it a
            go... a loved it! It was super messy but scratched my creative itch.
            <br />
            <br />
            Then, I got bolder üòè and tried abstract painting in acrylic. Loved
            that too and, bonus, didn't need to be able to draw! Then as I was
            looking through Youtube for abstract ideas, I came across a video
            from
            <a
              class="milan-link"
              target="_blank"
              href="https://www.milanartinstitute.com/"
              >Milan Art Institute</a
            >
            about their Mastery Program. I was a bit skeptical that they could
            make me a professional artist in just 1 year but looked at some of
            their students art as well as the teachers, Dimitra and Eli Milan's
            art and was amazed. But... that old insecurity said 'but you are
            really bad a drawing, you can't do that'. I listened to that
            annoying voice and decided to try the Beginner Program first to see
            what it was like and if I could improve.
            <br />
            <br />
            My goodness, did I improve!!! ü§Ø I am blown away by how much I have
            learnt and progressed in the 8 weeks of the course. Take a look at
            what I have achieved on the Beginner Program on the
            <a class="portfolio-link" href="/portfolio.html">Portfolio</a> page.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am now in the Mastery Program and will be sharing my journey
            throughout the year long course on Youtube, Instagram, Tiktok and on
            a weekly blog on this website. If you would like to follow my
            journey, all of the links to my social media are at the bottom of

          <h3>My Interests</h3>

          <h4>üé¨ Stories üìñ</h4>
          <p>
            I love stories in all forms; books, audiobooks, plays, musicals,
            movies and TV shows! I am a huge geek ü§ì, I'm that person who
            everyone comes to for film and TV knowledge (especially with Marvel,
            Harry Potter and Supernatural! üòÉ).
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />

          <h4>üéº Music, Singing, Dance & Theatre üé≠</h4>
          <p>
            I have a keen interest in singing and Musical Theatre. I have been
            doing lessons since I was 14 years old, have a Diploma in Musical
            Theatre and am working on an Associate Diploma. I did 12 years of
            dance lessons and have the medals to prove it üòâ. I loved drama at
            school, took part in school plays and even took it at college. I
            also took a 1 year Method Acting course in London a few years back.
            And I have been taking singing lessons since I was 14 years old. I
            would also love to learn piano and guitar!
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h4>üë©üèº‚Äçüéì Education üìö</h4>
          <p>
            As a nice compliment to my new aspirations I am half way through an
            Arts and Humanities degree focusing on Art History and Music with
            the Open University. I started this a year before I became
            interested in art again. ü§î It's almost like I was meant to be doing
            art all along!
            <br />
            <br />
            I have also been educating myself in the art of coding and web
            development. I designed and coded this website myself. If you are
            interested in finding out more or working with me on that front
